Hello, I'm a data engineer with a real passion for making data useful. What I enjoy most is the process of building systems that provide clear, reliable answers, empowering teams to move forward with confidence.

My journey into data was sparked by stories like Moneyball, which showed me the incredible power of looking at information in new ways. While I'm not working in sports just yet, I bring that same ambition to every project: to find the hidden patterns and build the automated systems that allow teams to make smarter, more confident decisions.

I believe success in this field comes down to three principles: persistence, perseverance, and patience. My first experience leading a full data migration was a turning point. It taught me the importance of creating a solid plan—from strategy to execution—and gave me the confidence to handle high-level projects.

When I'm not architecting data pipelines, you can usually find me passionately cheering on Arsenal—a 15-year commitment that has definitely taught me a thing or two about patience and perseverance!
