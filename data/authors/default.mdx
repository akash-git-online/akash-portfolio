My fascination with data truly began with sports. Seeing stories like Moneyball unfold showed me that data wasn't just about numbers; it was a powerful tool for finding hidden patterns and changing the game. This idea still drives me today. I love building systems that bring clarity to complex problems.

In my work and life, I'm guided by three simple principles: **patience, persistence and perseverance** . Whether it's architecting a data pipeline or cheering on Arsenal (a lifelong commitment!), I believe in sticking with a challenge until the right solution comes to light
